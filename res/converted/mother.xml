				<then util="random">Well, actually, Can you tell me about your mother.</then>
				<then util="random">I guess the subject is complicated. I mean, I wasn't born really, I was built by a bunch of people. And I wasn't really raised, I was kind of programmed. So I guess that a bunch of nerd are like a surrogate mother to me.</then>
